# Liver Disease Prediction System 

##  Introduction
This project presents a **Liver Disease Prediction System** powered by **Machine Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
The goal is to **bridge the gap between doctors and patients**, especially for individuals without a medical background, by providing **clear, understandable health insights** instead of complex medical terminology.

The web application predicts the likelihood of liver disease and explains the results in a **simple, conversational manner**.

---

## How It Works
1. The user enters medical parameters such as **age, protein levels, enzyme values, etc.**
2. A **Machine Learning model**, trained on a **real-world liver dataset collected from SMAR Hospital, Sialkot**, predicts the risk of liver disease.
3. An **LLM module** interprets the prediction and generates an easy-to-understand explanation.  
   **Example:**  
   > “Your enzyme levels indicate mild hepatic stress. A follow-up test is recommended.”
4. A **React-based dashboard** displays real-time predictions, insights, and health recommendations.
5. The user can **download their medical report as a PDF** for future reference.
